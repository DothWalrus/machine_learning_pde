# machine_learning_pde
This project is aimed at finding solutions to PDE's using neural networks.
1d_laplace_dgm trains a network to satisfy the Laplace equation in 1 dimension by penalizing boundary counditions and the differential opertator for interior points.
1d_laplace_dvm trains a network to satisfy the Laplace equation in 1 dimension by penalizing boundary counditions and minimizes Dirichlet energies on interior points.
